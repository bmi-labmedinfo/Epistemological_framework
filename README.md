# Epistemologically guided LLM reasoning for differential diagnosis
We propose a novel way of guiding LLM clinical reasoning, grounded on an epistemological model described in the 90s for knowledge-based Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) by [Ramoni and Stefanelli et al., 1992](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/199462). Our method constrains LLM inference to follow structured [reasoning phases](https://github.com/bmi-labmedinfo/Epistemological_framework/tree/main/computational_implementation/medical_reasoning_phases) — *abstraction*, *abduction*, *ranking*, *deduction*, and *induction*. 

The [framework](https://github.com/bmi-labmedinfo/Epistemological_framework/blob/main/computational_implementation/framework_implementation.py) is implemented in Python as a directed state graph using LangGraph. Each reasoning phase is represented by a node that stores intermediate artifacts in a shared state. To ensure structured and replicable intermediate representations, every node is constrained by Pydantic schemas to produce JSON-formatted output. All intermediate outputs are persistently recorded in a [structured log file](https://github.com/bmi-labmedinfo/Epistemological_framework/blob/main/computational_implementation/logging_file_generation.py) (per case and run).
