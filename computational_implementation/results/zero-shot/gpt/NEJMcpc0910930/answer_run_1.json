            "explanation": "\u2022 Classic occupational exposure (50\u202fy of ship\u2011yard plumbing work) and the presence of calcified diaphragmatic pleural plaques on CT are virtually pathognomonic for asbestos disease.  \n\u2022 The radiograph/CT pattern \u2013 basilar\u2011predominant coarse reticular opacities that progressed to honey\u2011comb change, traction bronchiectasis, septal thickening, and cystic lucencies \u2013 matches the usual evolution of asbestosis in an elderly, long\u2011term smoker.  \n\u2022 Clinical course (insidious dyspnoea over 6\u202fmonths, weight loss, chronic dry cough) fits a slowly progressive restrictive lung disease.  \n\u2022 Autopsy in similar cases most often shows diffuse interstitial fibrosis with asbestos bodies within macrophages, confirming this as the principal pathology.  \n\u2192 This is the single most plausible diagnosis and the foundation for most of the other findings (pulmonary\u2011vascular disease, cor\u2011pulmonale, acute decompensation)."

            "explanation": "\u2022 The patient is a 50\u2011pack\u2011year former smoker; CT demonstrated both cystic lucencies (emphysematous changes) and honey\u2011comb fibrosis, the hallmark of CPFE.  \n\u2022 CPFE produces severe arterial hypoxaemia disproportionate to relatively preserved lung volumes, explaining the profound desaturation (SpO\u2082 78\u202f% on room air) despite modest dyspnoea at rest.  \n\u2022 CPFE is strongly associated with pulmonary\u2011arterial hypertension and right\u2011ventricular failure, which were documented (RV dilation, elevated RV systolic pressure, tricuspid regurgitation, septal flattening)."

            "explanation": "\u2022 The dual\u2011chamber lead traverses the right atrium and right\u2011ventricular septum; chronic mechanical irritation can lead to leaflet tethering, regurgitation, and RV dilation.  \n\u2022 Moderate\u2011to\u2011severe tricuspid regurgitation was noted on echo, and this can exacerbate cor pulmonale in the setting of already high pulmonary pressures."
