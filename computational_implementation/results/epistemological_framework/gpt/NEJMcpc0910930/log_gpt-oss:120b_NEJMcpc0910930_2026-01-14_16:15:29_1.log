----- Ranking Phase -----
[2026-01-14 16:29:47]
🏁 RANKING — Hypotheses ordered by plausibility:

#1 — Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis leading to ARDS
  Parsimony: Requires the additional premise of an underlying IPF, making it less parsimonious than a single fibrotic process, but the acute ARDS component explains the rapid decompensation.
  Danger: Highest immediate danger; ARDS carries >50 % short‑term mortality and mandates emergent ICU care.
  Cost: High – needs bronchoscopy, BAL, high‑dose steroids, mechanical ventilation, and intensive monitoring.
  Curability: Very low; acute exacerbations are usually fatal despite maximal therapy.

#2 — Asbestosis
  Parsimony: A single occupational exposure accounts for the chronic interstitial changes, pleural plaques, and progressive dyspnea.
  Danger: Moderate; disease progresses slowly but can precipitate severe hypoxemia and right‑heart failure.
  Cost: Moderate – chest CT, pulmonary function testing, and occasional biopsy are sufficient.
  Curability: None; treatment is supportive, but disease progression can be slowed.

#3 — Pulmonary hypertension secondary to interstitial lung disease
  Parsimony: Adds only a hemodynamic consequence to the existing interstitial process, keeping the explanatory model simple.
  Danger: High; right‑ventricular failure can be rapidly fatal, especially when PH is severe.
  Cost: Moderate – echocardiography, right‑heart catheterisation if needed, and basic labs.
  Curability: Limited; PH can be partially managed but underlying fibrosis remains incurable.

#4 — Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE)
  Parsimony: Requires two co‑existing pathologies (upper‑lobe emphysema and lower‑lobe fibrosis), making it less simple than a single disease.
  Danger: Moderate to high; CPFE is associated with severe PH and rapid functional decline.
  Cost: Moderate – high‑resolution CT to delineate emphysema and fibrosis, pulmonary function tests.
  Curability: None; both components are irreversible, management is supportive.

#5 — Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
  Parsimony: A single idiopathic fibrotic process explains the imaging findings, but the known asbestos exposure makes a secondary cause more parsimonious.
  Danger: High; IPF has a median survival of 3‑5 years and can acutely worsen.
  Cost: Moderate – HRCT, PFTs, possibly lung biopsy.
  Curability: None; antifibrotic therapy may slow progression but cure is unavailable.

#6 — Pacemaker lead–induced tricuspid regurgitation causing cor pulmonale
  Parsimony: Adds a mechanical valve lesion to explain right‑heart failure, but imaging shows extensive interstitial disease, making this less simple.
  Danger: Low to moderate; tricuspid regurgitation contributes to RV overload but is not the primary driver of the acute hypoxemia.
  Cost: Low – echocardiography and lead imaging are inexpensive.
  Curability: Potentially correctable by lead revision, but patient’s overall prognosis remains poor due to lung disease.

#7 — Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) acute decompensation
  Parsimony: Explains dyspnea with preserved systolic function, yet fails to account for extensive interstitial changes and lack of volume overload.
  Danger: Moderate; HFpEF can cause pulmonary congestion but the patient’s refractory hypoxemia points to a pulmonary primary.
  Cost: Low – BNP, echo, diuretic trial.
  Curability: Manageable with diuretics and blood‑pressure control, but does not address underlying fibrosis.

#8 — Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)
  Parsimony: Adds chronic thrombus to explain PH, yet CT shows normal parenchyma and no evidence of thrombus, making it less parsimonious.
  Danger: High if present, but current data do not support it.
  Cost: High – V/Q scan, CT‑angiography, right‑heart catheterisation.
  Curability: Potentially curable with pulmonary endarterectomy, but unlikely in this case.

#9 — Malignant pleural mesothelioma
  Parsimony: Requires a malignant pleural process in addition to fibrosis; imaging lacks diffuse pleural thickening or effusion, reducing simplicity.
  Danger: Very high if present, but absent radiographic hallmarks lower immediate concern.
  Cost: High – PET‑CT, biopsy, pleural fluid analysis.
  Curability: Poor; limited to palliative measures.

#10 — Non‑small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell type
  Parsimony: Adds a solitary tumor to a picture dominated by diffuse interstitial disease, making it the least parsimonious.
  Danger: High if present, yet no mass or hemoptysis is observed.
  Cost: High – contrast CT, bronchoscopy, PET‑CT, biopsy.
  Curability: Potentially curable if early, but unlikely given lack of evidence.
